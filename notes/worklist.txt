Eccentrity(data) - for every point variance of the distance (eg. euclidean) to all other points
see notes on density function
    
for point p
    d = set of distances from all other non-p vars)
    eccentrity of p =  sqrt(avg(d . ^ 2))
    
See notes on density

Normalization functions required


Hypothesis Testing

Create table for KS test
columns = each column in dataset (variable) including categoricals/factors
rows = p values and statistic
order with lowest p value at the left

harder to sort horizontally

Or variables vertical list
Given two groupings, use sparkline/histograms

columns : VarName, Pvalue, KS statistic, G1Hist  G2Hist? 

could make varnames a button that opens window to ... date? other graph?




how to include categorical variables 
    coloring via percentage of the factor in that node
    ability to select categorical variable for coloring
